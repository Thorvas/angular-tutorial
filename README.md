# Angular Learning
This is a repository created through a process of learning. Currently, I am learning Angular framework from various sources (Pluralsight, internet forums, ChatGPT, etc.).




## What I've learned through process?

I've had little knowledge about Angular - I knew how it works in general, but I've never worked on code related to Angular's specifics. Therefore, my journey had to start from the very foundation of Angular's fundamental basics. 

The knowledge I gained through process of learning includes: 

- ðŸ“œ What is Angular and when do we use it
- ðŸ“œ How Angular is structured (Angular's components, services and views)
- ðŸ“œ How do we bootstrap basic Angular application
- ðŸ“œ How does Angular's modules, services, dependency injection, interpolation, data binding, and other mechanisms work
